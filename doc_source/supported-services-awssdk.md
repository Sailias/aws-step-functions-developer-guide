# AWS SDK service integrations<a name="supported-services-awssdk"></a>

AWS Step Functions integrates with AWS services, letting you call each service's API actions from your workflow\. You can use Step Functions' [AWS SDK integrations](#supported-services-awssdk) to call any of the over two hundred AWS services directly from your state machine, giving you access to over nine thousand API actions\. Or you can use [Step Functions's Optimized integrations](connect-supported-services.md), each of which has been customized to provide special functionality for your workflow\.

Some services or SDKs may not be available as AWS SDK integrations, either temporarily or permanently, for a variety of reasons\. Very new services may not be available immediately\. Some services require customized configuration, such as specifying a customer\-specific endpoint, which may be more suitable for an optimized integration\. Some SDKs are unsuitable for use in a workflow, such as those for streaming audio or video\. Finally, some services may be withheld until they pass certain internal validations performed by Step Functions\.

To use AWS SDK integrations, you specify the service name and API call, and, optionally, a [service integration pattern](connect-to-resource.md)\. Note that the API action will always be camel case, and parameter names will be Pascal case\. For example, you could use Step Functions' `startSyncExecution` API action and specify the parameter `StateMachineArn`\. You can call AWS SDK services directly from the Amazon States Language in the `Resource` field of a task state\. To do this, use the following syntax:

`arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:serviceName:apiAction.[serviceIntegrationPattern]`

For example, for Amazon EC2, you might use `arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:ec2:describeInstances`\. This would return output as defined for the [Amazon EC2 describeInstances](Amazon EC2 API ReferenceAPI_DescribeInstances.html#API_DescribeInstances_ResponseElements) API call\. 

Step Functions can't autogenerate IAM policies for AWS SDK integrations\. After you create your state machine, you will need to navigate to the IAM console and configure your role policies\. See [IAM Policies for integrated services](service-integration-iam-templates.md) for more information\.

See the [Gather Amazon S3 bucket info using AWS SDK service integrations](tutorial-gather-s3-bucket-info-using-aws-sdk-service-integrations.md) tutorial for an example of how to use AWS SDK integrations\.
