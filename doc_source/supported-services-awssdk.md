# AWS SDK service integrations<a name="supported-services-awssdk"></a>

AWS Step Functions integrates with AWS services, letting you call each service's API actions from your workflow\. You can use Step Functions' [AWS SDK integrations](#supported-services-awssdk) to call almost any AWS service's API actions from your state machine\. You can also use [Step Functions's Optimized integrations](connect-supported-services.md), each of which has been customized to provide special functionality for your workflow\.

Some services or SDKs may not be available as AWS SDK integrations, either temporarily or permanently\. Recently released services may not have SDK interactions available until a later update\. Some services require customized configuration, such as specifying a customer\-specific endpoint, which may be more suitable for an optimized integration\. Other SDKs are unsuitable for use in a workflow, such as those for streaming audio or video\. Finally, some services may be withheld until they pass certain internal validations performed by Step Functions\.

## Using AWS SDK service integrations<a name="use-awssdk-integ"></a>

To use AWS SDK integrations, you specify the service name and API call and, optionally, a [service integration pattern](connect-to-resource.md)\.

**Note**  
The API action will always be camel case, and parameter names will be Pascal case\. For example, you could use Step Functions' `startSyncExecution` API action and specify the parameter `StateMachineArn`\.

You can call AWS SDK services directly from the Amazon States Language in the `Resource` field of a task state\. To do this, use the following syntax:

`arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:serviceName:apiAction.[serviceIntegrationPattern]`

For example, for Amazon EC2, you might use `arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:ec2:describeInstances`\. This would return output as defined for the [Amazon EC2 describeInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeInstances.html#API_DescribeInstances_ResponseElements) API call\. 

If an AWS SDK integration encounters an error, the resulting Error field will be composed of the service name and the error name, separated by a period character: `ServiceName.ErrorName`\. Both the service name and error name are in Pascal case\. You can also see the service name, in lowercase, in the Task state's Resource field\. You can find the potential error names in the target service's API reference documentation\. 

For example, you might use the `arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:acmpca:deleteCertificateAuthority` AWS SDK integration\. The [AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteCertificateAuthority.html#API_DeleteCertificateAuthority_Errors) indicates that the `DeleteCertificateAuthority` API action can result in a `ResourceNotFoundException`, for example\. To handle this error, you would thus specify the Error `AcmPca.ResourceNotFoundException` in your Task state's Retriers or Catchers\. For more information on error handling in Step Functions, see [Error handling in Step Functions](concepts-error-handling.md)\. 

Step Functions can't autogenerate IAM policies for AWS SDK integrations\. After you create your state machine, you will need to navigate to the IAM console and configure your role policies\. See [IAM Policies for integrated services](service-integration-iam-templates.md) for more information\.

See the [Gather Amazon S3 bucket info using AWS SDK service integrations](tutorial-gather-s3-bucket-info-using-aws-sdk-service-integrations.md) tutorial for an example of how to use AWS SDK integrations\.

## Supported AWS SDK service integrations<a name="supported-services-awssdk-list"></a>

The following table lists the AWS SDK service integrations supported by Step Functions\. The *`Task` state resource* column lists the syntax to call a specific API action when using the itegration for the service specified in the *Service name* column on the left\. The *Date supported* column provides information about the dates on which the API actions were supported for each of the services\. In addition, the *Exception prefix* column on the right, lists the exception prefixes for each service integration\. These exception prefixes are present in the exceptions that are generated when you erroneously perform an AWS SDK service integration with Step Functions\.
