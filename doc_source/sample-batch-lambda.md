# AWS Batch with Lambda<a name="sample-batch-lambda"></a>

This sample project demonstrates how to use Step Functions to pre\-process data with AWS Lambda functions and then orchestrate AWS Batch jobs\. Deploying this sample project will create an AWS Step Functions state machine, a Lambda function, and an AWS Batch job\.

In this project, Step Functions uses a state machine to invoke a Lambda function to do simple pre\-processing before an AWS Batch job is submitted\. Multiple jobs may be invoked depending on the result/success of the previous one\.

## Create the State Machine and Provision Resources<a name="sample-batch-lambda-create"></a>

1. Open the [AWS Batch with Lambda](https://console.aws.amazon.com/states/home#/sampleProjects?batchWithLambda) sample project\.

   The state machine **Code** and **Visual Workflow** are displayed\.  
![\[Manage AWS Batch workflow.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/images/sample-batch-lambda.png)

1. Choose **Next**\.

   The **Deploy and run** page is displayed, listing the resources that will be created\. For this sample project, the resources include:
   + An AWS Batch job
   + A Lambda function

1. Choose **Deploy Resources**\.
**Note**  
It can take up to 10 minutes for these resources and related IAM permissions to be created\. While the **Deploy resources** page is displayed, you can open the **Stack ID** link to see which resources are being provisioned\.

## Start a New Execution<a name="sample-batch-lambda-start-execution"></a>

1. On the **New execution** page, enter an execution name \(optional\), and then choose **Start Execution**\.

1. \(Optional\) To identify your execution, you can specify a name for it in the **Name** box\. By default, Step Functions generates a unique execution name automatically\.
**Note**  
Step Functions allows you to create state machine, execution, and activity names that contain non\-ASCII characters\. These non\-ASCII names don't work with Amazon CloudWatch\. To ensure that you can track CloudWatch metrics, choose a name that uses only ASCII characters\.

1. Optionally, you can go to the newly created state machine on the Step Functions **Dashboard**, and then choose **New execution**\.

1. When an execution is complete, you can select states on the **Visual workflow** and browse the **Input** and **Output** under **Step details**\.

## Example State Machine Code<a name="sample-batch-lambda-code-examples"></a>

The state machine in this sample project integrates with AWS Batch and Amazon SNS by passing parameters directly to those resources\. 

Browse through this example state machine to see how Step Functions controls AWS Batch and Amazon SNS by connecting to the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) in the `Resource` field, and by passing `Parameters` to the service API\.

For more information about how AWS Step Functions can control other AWS services, see [Using AWS Step Functions with other services](concepts-service-integrations.md)\.

## IAM Example<a name="sample-batch-lambda-iam-example"></a>

These example AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) policies generated by the sample project includes the least privilege necessary to execute the state machine and related resources\. We recommend that you include only those permissions that are necessary in your IAM policies\.

**Example `BatchJobWithLambdaAccessPolicy`**  

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [

            "Effect": "Allow"
        },
        {
