# AWS Step Functions Workflow Studio<a name="workflow-studio"></a>



Workflow Studio for AWS Step Functions is a low\-code visual workflow designer for Step Functions that lets you create serverless workflows by orchestrating AWS services\. Use drag and drop to create and edit workflows, control how input and output is filtered or transformed for each state, and configure error handling\. As you create a workflow, Workflow Studio validates your work and auto\-generates code\. You can review the generated code, or export it for local development or AWS CloudFormation\. When you are finished, you can save your workflow, run it, then examine the results in the Step Functions console\. You can also use Workflow Studio to prototype new workflows and use your prototypes as the starting point for local development with the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code\.

To use Step Functions Workflow Studio, you will need an AWS account, and credentials that provide the correct permissions for any resources you want to use\. For more information, see [Prerequisites for Getting Started with AWS Step Functions](sfn-prerequisites.md)\.

You can access Workflow Studio from the [Step Functions console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/states/home?region=us-east-1#/), when you create or edit a workflow in Step Functions\.
